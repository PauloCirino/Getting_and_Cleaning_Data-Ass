#Getting and Cleaning Data - MOOC Coursera
I'm Paulo Cirino Ribeiro Neto, and In This CodeBook I'll explain all of the variables used in run_analysis.R
But First of all, Let me say that I'm sorry for my broken english.
==================================================================

To run this script you'll need first to extract the http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones dataset in your current working directory.
You don't have to(and can't) move the files out of their original folders.
After extracting the .zip file in your current working directory just type in the R shell :
>source("run_analysis.R")
And that is it .
Gook Luck!
